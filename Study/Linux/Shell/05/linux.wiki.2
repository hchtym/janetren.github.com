Linux is a generic term referring to Unix-like computer operating systems based on 
the Linux kernel. Their development is one of the most prominent examples of free and 
open source software collaboration; typically all the underlying source code can be 
used, freely modified, and redistributed by anyone under the terms of the GNU GPL and 
other free software licences.

Linux is predominantly known for its use in servers, although it is installed on a 
wide variety of computer hardware, ranging from embedded devices and mobile phones to 
supercomputers. Linux distributions, installed on both desktop and laptop computers, 
have become increasingly commonplace in recent years, partly owing to the popular 
Ubuntu distribution and the emergence of netbooks.
