                        <p align="left">If there's one thing that's been the most valuable
                          to me in my success as an online marketer, it's words.
                          Not just writing, but words too. So you're in marketing,
                          and want to make a bunch of cash, where do you start?
                          How about:<br />
                          <br />
                        Write and perfect sales letters<br />
                        <br />
                        Write and test ad copy<br />
                        <br />
                        E-mail your lists with ads and content<br />
                        <br />
                        Write your own products<br />
                        <br />
                        Plan products that aren't necessarily written<br />
                        <br />
                        Contact joint venture partners<br />
                        <br />
                        The list just goes on and on. If there's one thing that
                        you need to know how to do to succeed in this business,
                        it's write. Why are you still reading? It's only been
                        a few sentences, but what did I say to get you here?
                        It's slightly annoying when someone does it to you. but
                        imagine having that power yourself. Having your readers,
                        no matter the material, hang on your every word. </p>
                        <p align="center"><span class="style1">Now hold on there,<br /> 
                          before we go
                          any further..</span></p>
                        <p align="left">Just to clarify, I see
                          all these people with degrees in psychology, and with
                          initials in front of their names that are trying to
                          teach people how to write persuasively, or to keep
                          a potential customer reading when they hit a sales
                          page. I read their stuff. It confused the heck out
                          of me. Now I might not have pretty initials in front
                          of my name, and I might not have a degree, but I have
                          been writing and talking to persuade since I was eight
                          years old. It's not gone badly considering I now do
                          it for a living.<br />
                          <br />
                          This time around however, I wanted to do something
                          a little bit differently as far as teaching others
                          to control the actions and thoughts of their website
                          visitors. It's all coming from my own experiences.
                        No degrees at all, just pure, 100%, real world experience.</p>
                        <p align="center" class="style1"> How much could you make if you could control your
                          readers actions?<br />

                          of everything we do) <br />

                            seen profitable results after using it for 30 days,
                            (results that must exceed your expectations) I&rsquo;m
