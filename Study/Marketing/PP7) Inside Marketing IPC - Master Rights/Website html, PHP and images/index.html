                    <td class="style6"><p align="left">Dear Online Marketer,</p>
                        <p align="left">Wouldn't it be great to be able to control other peoples
                          thoughts? Imagine how many of your products you could
                          sell then. In fact, forget the products for now, how
                          about being able to spot a scam from a mile off? Or,
                        how would you like to be able to resist corporate marketing.
                          While everybody else is controlled by it and follows
                          it, you're setting the standards, the fashions and
                          influencing opinions. It feels pretty good to be able
                          to do that. <br />
                          <br />
                        It's a very powerful position to be in, and I'm going
                        to show you exactly how you can get there, just by understanding
                        what goes on in the mind of marketers. Not just online,
                        but offline too. <br />
                        <br />
                        Sure, there's cliche's out there that everyone knows.
                        There's the whole 'secret' thing (which is way overused),
                        but aside from that, did you know that the ads you see
                        on TV, the ads in publications and on websites are finely
                        crafted, with thought going into every word. Each one
                        with a purpose, the majority of the time influencing
                        peoples actions for the sole purpose of getting them
                        to buy something.<br />
                        <br />
                        It happens to everyone, and unless you understand this
                        whole letter, you're being controlled by it too.    
                         An uncomfortable thought, (and I get bucket loads of
                        hate e-mail for saying things like that) but it's easily
                        avoided. Easily controlled and bent to you own advantage
                        even, if you know what you're doing.</p>
                        <p align="center" class="style1">&quot;Before we go any
                          further..&quot;</p>
                        <p align="left">Let me let you in to an example of exactly
                          what I mean. So, here we were, Friday night, pizza,
                          and a couple of drinks watching a DVD and just relaxing,
                          and talking. The DVD ends and we switch back to the
                          TV. The conversation turns to marketing, so I began
                          trying to explain to them about the media and the methods
                          they use to control people's actions. Most of them
                          downright unethical, derogatory and insulting. But
                          people still buy it (even those who assume the odd
                          cliche such as 'secret formulas' and 'be your own boss'
                          catchphrases and 'exploding bank account' buzz words
                          is what marketing is about).<br />
                          <br />
                          Anyway, <em><strong><u>literally</u></strong></em> thirty seconds after we stop talking
                          about that, an ad comes on TV. Totally insulting to
                          any man/woman looking to buy that product. 100% legal
                          of course, but verging on breaking ethical boundaries,
                          almost insulting. There was a short silence, and then
                          it came.<br />
                          <br />
                          &quot;Wow, that looks good. I'm gonna grab some in the morning&quot;.<br />
                          <br />
                          The person who had just said he doesn't fall for marketing
                          and would never buy a product that was advertised in
                          a negative or unethical way, just fell for it! Again!
                          Now I can't reveal too much more about that example,
                          or what the ad was for now, but take it from me..</p>
                        <p align="left"><em><strong><u>Every single ad you see</u></strong></em>, anywhere, created by serious
                          marketers is 100% crafted, word for word. It's not
                          just the little cliche' catch phrases that have the
                          effect on your mind. There's much more.</p>
                        <p align="left" class="style6">So this is where I get
                          to teach you my special little skill
                          that makes me a whole load of cash, (the one that everybody
                          assumes they understand, and fall for it 30 seconds
                          later). Get this, I insult people, and they give me
                          money for it. I be nice and helpful, and they give
                          me money for it. <strong>This is what real marketing is about. </strong></p>
                        <p align="center" class="style1">Master it, and the world is your oyster <br />
                          (and the people
                          in it, even those who think they're invulnerable) </p>

They're so obvious about it, every says 'pah I see what you're trying to do' and discounts anything they've been told so far. Devastating to any sales process. My approach cuts that problem out totally, and you'll make a load more sales because of it.</p>

Everything is pulled straight from real life. No fluff. It's just how things work. Understand it, use it, learn from it, or fail. Simple as that.</p>

I'm not all that brainy, I have no degree or special characters before or after my name. I did however succeed beyond even my expectations. How? Well, I cheated to be honest. Not unethically, not ripping anybody off, but as far as most marketers are concerned I cheated. I cut out the bits that didn't work, and concentrated on those that do. Simple huh? All you need to know is what works and what doesn't, and you're set. Luckily I had many great contacts to learn from when I began. If you don't have that luxury right now, this is for you. </p>
